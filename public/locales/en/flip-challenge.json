  "A flip is a sort of a CAPTCHA that helps to determine whether a user is human. In contrast to a CAPTCHA, which stands for \"Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart\" and is usually generated by an automated service, a flip should be created by a human. And unlike a usual CAPTCHA, which is based on object recognition, solving a flip requires a semantic interpretation of the relationship between objects.": "A flip is a sort of a CAPTCHA that helps to determine whether a user is human.

  "Each flip contains two stories in pictures. One of them (left or right) is a sequence of pictures that is created by a human as a meaningful story. The other is created by the same author as illogical. Stories are \"read\" from top to bottom. Solving a flip is choosing the story that seems logical. If both stories seem meaningful or meaningless, the task is still to choose the one which seems more logical than the other and thus would rather be chosen by other people.": "Each flip contains two stories in pictures.
