                      <p>
                        1. Spot a reputable journalist that might be interested
                        in learning and telling their audience about Idena.{' '}
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        2. Contact them and educate them about Idena: why you
                        consider the project unique and valuable, what makes you
                        support it. Learn more about the journalist you are
                        going to pitch and be creative: They receive hundreds of
                        messages every day, your pitch should stand out. Be
                        polite and respectful. Please note: We will not pay
                        journalists for publications. They should get interested
                        in covering Idena because they see value for their
                        audience in it.{' '}
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        3. When you receive a reply, provide additional
                        information. Feel free to reach out to the Idena
                        community or the Idena team if you need more data or
                        explanations that you cannot find on the Idena website
                        or in the Idena blog.{' '}
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        4. This may be the right time to email proof of your
                        communications at info@idena.io. Please don't do it
                        until you get a positive reply.{' '}
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        5. When a publication is out (the result may be a full
                        media piece about Idena or a quality mention - not just
                        the name of the project, but also the project's
                        description), email the link to it and your Idena wallet
                        address at info@idena.io and get a reward.{' '}
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        6. A publication may often be a result of a joint
                        effort. If more than one community member claims that
                        their independent communication with a journalist
                        resulted in a publication, the reward is paid to three
                        community members with the most substantial and quality

                      <p>
                        1. Spot a reputable blogger (crypto, tech, finance,
                        human rights) that might be interested in learning and
                        telling their audience about Idena.{' '}
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        2. Contact them and educate them about Idena: why you
                        consider the project unique and valuable, what makes you
                        support it. Learn more about the blogger you are going
                        to pitch and be creative: They receive hundreds of
                        messages every day, your pitch should stand out. Be
                        polite and respectful. Please note: We will not pay
                        bloggers for publications. They should get interested in
                        covering Idena because they see value for their audience
                        in it.{' '}
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        3. When you receive a reply, provide additional
                        information. Feel free to reach out to the Idena
                        community or the Idena team if you need more data or
                        explanations that you cannot find on the Idena website
                        or in the Idena blog.{' '}
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        4. This may be the right time to email proof of your
                        communications at info@idena.io. Please don't do it
                        until you get a positive reply.{' '}
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        5. When a publication is out (the result may be a full
                        media piece about Idena or a quality mention - not just
                        the name of the project, but also the project's
                        description), email the link to it and your Idena wallet
                        address at info@idena.io and get a reward.{' '}

                      <p>
                        6. A publication may often be a result of a joint
                        effort. If more than one community member claims that
                        their independent communication with a blogger resulted
                        in a publication, the reward is paid to three community
                        members with the most substantial and quality
                        communication with the publication's author out of those
